Graduation Project for CodeLabsAcademy in order to include all the material we learn so far! This project made for a barbershop for the personal use of the Barber where he can add appointments for his customers in a Calendar.

**Quick Start (Codex/Cli friendly)**
- Install deps once in each app:
  - `cd barber-backend && npm install`
  - `cd barber-frontend && npm install`
- From repo root, run both apps:
  - `npm run dev` (spawns backend + frontend)
  - or `make dev` if you prefer Makefile targets

**Useful Commands (from repo root)**
- Backend dev: `npm run dev:backend` or `make backend`
- Frontend dev: `npm run dev:frontend` or `make frontend`
- Backend start (prod): `npm start` or `make start`
- Frontend build: `npm run build:frontend` or `make build-frontend`

These root commands make it easy for Codex to start and manage both services without navigating into subfolders.
